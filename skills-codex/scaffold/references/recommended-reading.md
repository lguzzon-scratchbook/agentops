# Recommended Reading for Future Scaffolding Work

> Forward-looking index of external skills and methodologies worth absorbing into `scaffold` (or a sibling skill) when the right trigger arrives. Not active dependencies; just breadcrumbs so high-utility sources are not lost.

## How to use this file

When a trigger condition listed below fires (new transport surface, new agent-API workload, new boilerplate domain), revisit the named source, evaluate whether the patterns still apply, and absorb the load-bearing ideas into the relevant SKILL.md or a new `references/*.md`. Do not bulk-import — extract only what is currently load-bearing. Append new candidates to the table below when a fresh source crosses the bar (recurring citations, repeated value, or distinct framing not already captured).

## Candidates

| Skill / source | Origin | Why relevant to scaffold | Trigger to absorb |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mcp-server-design` | jsm / ACFS | Agent-facing tool UX patterns: anticipating how agents misuse APIs, structured "fail helpfully" errors, "agent theory of mind" framing for tool design, and `make the wrong thing impossible` as a north star for boilerplate defaults. Useful when scaffold output is itself an agent-facing tool surface (MCP server, CLI agent, daemon). Scored 1.00 in the 2026-05-03 jsm utility map. | When agentopsd MCP transport work begins, or when a new scaffold mode targets MCP/agent-tool servers. |

## Entry shape

When adding a new candidate, keep the same four fields so the table stays easy to scan:

- **Skill / source** — name and (if external) the upstream owner.
- **Origin** — where the skill currently lives (jsm/ACFS, third-party repo, internal experiment).
- **Why relevant to scaffold** — one or two sentences naming the specific patterns scaffold could borrow. Phrase the takeaway in our own words; do not paste the source's description verbatim.
- **Trigger to absorb** — the concrete condition that should re-open this absorption candidate. Avoid vague triggers ("when relevant"); name the workload, surface, or epic.
